  January 2016 - Major update

  Attiny85 firmware for the tinyTouche project.
  https://github.com/kehribar/tinyTouche

  This project is based on Disney Touch√© 
  http://www.disneyresearch.com/research/projects/hci_touche_drp.htm

  The firmware is written from scratch, but the implementation idea
  comes from the Sprite_tm's engarde project.
